MatchMaking Percent: 
	-Min : percent under your skill level
	-Max : percent over your skill level
MatchMaking Relative :
	-Min : skill level's points under your skill level
	-Max : skill level's points over your skill level
MatchMakingRequest :
	-action : not required, work without this line (not empty, just don't write action if you don't have one)
	-create a room : all players have to fit with each other to create a match
		Example :
			player1 skill level : 10
			player2 skill level : 20
			MatchMaking : percent, min : 0, max : 500
			player1 will found player2, but player2 will not find player1, so the match don't start

The Status of a challenge change if certains conditions are reach. At the creation of a challenge, you have to set the startTime and the status will be "ISSUED".
When the MaxPlayer parameters is reach (set at the creation of the challenge and/or in the MatchMaking) and the startTime isn't, the status will be "WAITING".
When MinPlayer the StartTime are reach, the status will be "RUNNING". You can manually force the beginning of a challenge in the Cloud Code with challenge.startChallenge(); (see GlobalMessage ChallengeWaitingMessage)
The ScriptData contain all customizable values
/!\ You can't change the ScriptData if the challenge isn't in the "RUNNING" status.
You have to create the data to send in the Cloud Code in the Global Message ChallengeIssuedMessage or in the ChallengeWaitingMessage
/!\ To get the ScriptData client side, you have to write : gameBoard = response.Challenge.ScriptData.GetStringList("gameBoard").ToArray();

If you receive this message when you try to change the game state : 
{"message":"TypeError: Cannot read property \"challengeId\" from undefined (challengeEvent/LifeCount.js#8)"}
Try to change the line
var challenge = Spark.data.challenge.challengeId
to
var challenge = Spark.getChallenge(Spark.getData().challengeInstanceId);
(see ChallengeEvent LifeCount)
