Comment:
	As the Login on facebook isn't done, we don't have a fully functional prototype.
	The login via facebook could link GameSpark and Playfab without problem.
	But if using the custom login of PlayFab, it doesn't work well with GameSparks
	which require to be logged in GameSpark for the Matchmaking. So it would require
	a duplication of accounts on both website.

GameSparks 

	-MatchMaking => MatchMakingManager :
		ContinueChallenge => void CurrentChallenge line 126 => if found, void SpawnPopUp line 174 to accept the first of them else SearchMatch
		SearchMatch => public void RankedMatch line 52 => MatchFound
		MatchFound => void OnMatchFound line 71 => if player 1 CreateChallenge else FindChallenge
		CreateChallenge => void CreateChallenge line 106 => FindChallenge
		FindChallenge => IEnumerator FindChallenge line 181 => ChallengeFound line 191

	-TurnBased => PlayerControl :
		LoadInformations => First in the Start line 12, then Check
		Check => public IEnumerator Check line 100 for "real-time" game

	-GameState => TurnManager :
		SaveGameState => public void EndTurn line 29

	-Register/Authenticate
		Register => RegisterPlayer_SampleScript => public void RegisterPlayerBttn line 19
		Authenticate => AuthenticatePlayer_SampleScript => public void AuthenticatePlayerBttn line 18


PlayFab
	-Login via Facebook :
		Login => LoginFBGooglePanel, also use the FB class of the facebook SDK
	
	-Login/Register via PlayFab :
		Login/Register => LoginRegPanel

	-Rankings Update/Get :
		Update => GameMenuPanel
		Get => LeaderboardScript

	-Elo Algorythm :
		ELORanking
